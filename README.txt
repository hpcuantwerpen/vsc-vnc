This projects contains a number of files use on our clusters to ease the 
use of VNC.

Developed by Kurt Lust @ UAntwerp/VSC

Example EasyBuild files can be found on the GitHub repository
https://github.com/hpcuantwerpen/vsc-vnc/
As these are currently use the Tarball EasyBlock, we have not included them
in the release archive to not interfer with whatever local policies you may
have and since they are of no use in the install directories for those who
don't use EasyBuild.
